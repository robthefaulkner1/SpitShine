# Spit Shine San Antonio — Website

> San Antonio's Mobile Detailing & Ceramic Coating Specialists — We Come to You.

A fast, mobile-first, conversion-focused static website for **Spit Shine San Antonio**
(mobile auto detailing, ceramic coatings, and paint correction). Built to the brand's
copy package, website blueprint, and design rulebook.

No build tooling is required to host it — the `.html`, `css/`, `js/`, and `assets/`
files are plain static assets you can drop on any host.

  Metallic Silver `#C0C0C0`, Graphite `#4A4A4A`, Light Gray `#E5E5E5`.

  - sticky header (transparent → solid on scroll)
  - sticky mobile Call / Free-Quote bar
  - click-to-call links throughout
  - trust bars, CTA bands, FAQ accordion, scroll-reveal animations
  - `LocalBusiness` (AutoDetailing) schema on every page + `FAQPage` schema on the FAQ.

## Editing & rebuilding

The HTML pages are **generated** so the shared header, footer, SEO meta, and schema stay
consistent. Source of truth:

- `build.py` — template, design components, SEO/schema, and **`CONFIG`** (phone, email, etc.)
- `pages_content.py` — the copy/body of each page.

To regenerate the HTML after editing either file:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

You can also edit the generated `.html` files directly if you prefer — just note that a
re-run of `build.py` will overwrite them.

### ⚠️ Replace these placeholders before going live
Open `build.py` → `CONFIG` and update:

| Key | Replace with |
|-----|--------------|
| `phone_display` / `phone_tel` | Your real phone number (the `tel:` value must be E.164, e.g. `+12105551234`) |
| `email` | Your real business email |
| `domain` | Your live domain (used in canonical URLs, sitemap, and schema) |
| `form_endpoint` | A [Formspree](https://formspree.io) (or CRM) endpoint to receive form submissions |
| `social` | Your Facebook / Instagram / Google Business URLs |

Then re-run `python3 build.py` and update `sitemap.xml` / `robots.txt` with your domain.

---

## Forms

The contact and booking forms currently run **front-end only** — on submit they show a
confirmation message. To receive real submissions by email, paste a Formspree endpoint into
`CONFIG["form_endpoint"]` and rebuild; the JS (`js/main.js`) will POST to it automatically.
For live, real-time scheduling, embed Calendly / Acuity / GoHighLevel into `book.html`.

---

## Images

Photo slots are marked with labeled placeholders (e.g. *"Ceramic Coating Water-Beading"*).
Drop a real image into a placeholder by replacing the `<div class="media">…</div>` block with:

```html
<div class="media"><img src="assets/your-photo.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt text"></div>
```

High-impact spots to prioritize: **hero backgrounds**, **before/after paint correction**,
and **ceramic water-beading**. (See `js/main.js` and `css/styles.css` `.media` for styling.)

---

## Local preview

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploy

Any static host works — GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or traditional
hosting. For GitHub Pages, the included `.nojekyll` file ensures all assets are served as-is.

### GitHub Pages (automated)

This repo ships a deploy workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. On every push to
`main` it publishes the site to GitHub Pages automatically.

One-time setup: in **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (the workflow
also attempts to enable this on its first run). After the first successful run, your site is
live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/SpitShine/`. To use a custom domain, add it under
Settings → Pages and update `CONFIG["domain"]` in `build.py`.
